Revision history for Perl extension String::Dirify.

1.03  2016-05-11T09:21:00
	- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Spec::Changes
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.
	- Adopt new repo structure. For details, see
		http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
		This includes switching from the Artistic V 1.0 licence to the Perl licence.
		And this in turn satisfies a request from Emmanuel Seyman who is right now packaging this
		distro for Fedora.
	- Reformat POD so lines are no more than 100 chars wide. This is my (Ron's) personal policy.
